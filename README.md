Hello! I’m a Solo Developer & Full-stack Engineer.

I balance my professional career with active solo game development as a Steam publisher. Recently, I’ve been focusing on integrating Evolving AI into gameplay to create more dynamic and adaptive player experiences.

On the technical side, I specialize in high-performance server management. I enjoy optimizing systems by designing custom Memory Pools and Thread Pools for seamless non-blocking development, while leveraging the Spring/Java ecosystem for reliable blocking communication.

Lately, I have been diving deep into Reverse Engineering to better protect my applications from bugs and exploit tools (hacks). My goal is to build robust, secure-by-design systems that can withstand real-world vulnerabilities.

I am always open to outsourcing and freelance opportunities. If you are looking for a developer who can handle both solid server stability and complex game logic, let's connect!
